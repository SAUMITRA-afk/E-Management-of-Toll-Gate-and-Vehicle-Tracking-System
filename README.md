• In this project I proposed “Toll Gate” which is a web based application that have complete 
details of a Toll Gate Company details like Toll gate details, staff details, user details 
and Fare details of each toll booth and collection details of each toll booth.
• The above aim can be established by implementing a layout structure modules and 
each module can have many sub modules. 
• Admin is responsible for creating all toll gate details, branch details, staff details, user 
details and Fare details. 
• This system is based CMS website Concept. Admin is responsible for giving 
username and password for user as well as access level. It has user interface module. 
• User can login through our site and access the service offered by the admin.
• The Aim of these project is to keep complete details about fare collection and user 
details.
• User can registered with the site and access the service offered by the admin.
• User will get toll gate pass through our System. It may lead to reduce the access time.
